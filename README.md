# Survival-Analysis

The goal of this project is to create a CLV (customer lifetime value) model for a telecommunication company using parametric models. First, accelerated time failure (ATF) models are built using various distributions: Weibull, lognormal, loglogistic, exponential, and generalized gamma distributions. The models are then compared based on various metrics and the best model is selected as the final model to calculate CLV. Afterward, CLV is calculated per customer using the model. CLV is examined across different customer segments and conclusions are drawn from the analysis. The Jupyter Notebook file contains all the code and explanations for each step of the analysis, as well as the final report. Overall, the project provides a comprehensive approach to building a CLV model using parametric models and studying the analysis results.
